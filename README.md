This is a game I'm making as a project, in which you inherit an apartment from your grandma and the goal, as is in life, is to gain as much money as you can.
So far, it doesn't quite work on Windows as it doesn't display extended ascii characters correctly. I am working on this but for now, just please use Linux.
More information will be added soon.
